# [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two
children, referred to as the `left` child and the `right` child.

A binary search tree is a special type of tree that maintains order on the
nodes, where the `left` child is smaller than its parent node and the
`right` child is larger than its parent node.  This allows search to occur
in `O(logn)` time, which is the height of the tree.

## Thoughts

I'll implement a basic binary search tree that can be used as the basis
of other exercises that use the properties of binary search.
